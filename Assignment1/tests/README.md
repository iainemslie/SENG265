# Test files SENG 265 Summer 2017 (UVic)

The files in this directory consist of pairs. For example:
* t01.txt and t01.ph1 are a pair
* t02.txt and t02.ph1 are a pair
* etc.

For assignment #1 there are ten such sets of pairs. Each "test" therefore is
a pair of files. Therefore the third test consist of t03.txt and t03.ph1
(i.e., t03.ph1 is the result of correctly performing the forward-direction
transform in A#1 for the text contained in t03.txt).
